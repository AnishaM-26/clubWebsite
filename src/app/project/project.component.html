										<h3><a href="#">Fire Emergency System</a></h3>
										<p style="color: white;">Fires in general are a big problem and risk to major public operations, as well as to life. According to India Risk Survey 2016, fire outbreak was ranked 8th biggest risk to businesses. Similarly according to a recent study, over 21 cities in India recorded 80% deaths due to fire outbreaks. Having a device which can point the location of fire and alarm the officials of it, as well as cure it before it turns into a major fire would be a big step to decrease it's impact. Our fire emergency system helps to cure this problem.</p>
										<p style="color: white;">
											During a fire outbreak, the gas sensors present in each room would alarm the officials of that building about the fire outbreak. The officials, after confirming if the alarm is true or not, could open the door or the respective block/room through a control keypad, and help to resolve the fire before it turns out into a major outbreak. The keypad would prevent opening the door automatically in case of a false alarm, and the fire cure systems inside every room shall help to put it out before it even begins spreading.

										<h3><a href="#">Smart Irrigation System</a></h3>
										<p style="color: white;">
											Living requires water. This project proposes an intelligent Irrigation system which describes how irrigation can be handled smartly using IOT. The objective of this system is to detect the moisture content of the soil and depending on it sprinkle water .This
entire information will be sent to the userâ€™s mobile phone. The Soil Moisture Sensor is used to measure the volumetric water content in the soil. This makes it ideal for performing experiments in plants by having constant information about the amount of water currently present in soil and accordingly providing water to the plants for proper nourishment.
This includes constant checking of moisture content in soil and sending the readings to the android application. If the moisture content is less than the threshold value (which is pre-fed into the arduino board), a prompt message is sent to the device and automatically a sprinkler connected to the arduino will start sprinkling water on the affected area.
