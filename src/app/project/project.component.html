										<h3><a href="https://spectrumcet.com/First_project.html" target = "_blank">Fire Emergency System</a></h3>
										<p style="color: white;">Fires in general are a big problem and risk to major public operations, as well as to life. According to India Risk Survey 2016, fire outbreak was ranked 8th biggest risk to businesses. Similarly according to a recent study, over 21 cities in India recorded 80% deaths due to fire outbreaks. Having a device which can point the location of fire and alarm the officials of it, as well as cure it before it turns into a major fire would be a big step to decrease it's impact. Our fire emergency system helps to cure this problem.</p>
										<p style="color: white;">
											During a fire outbreak, the gas sensors present in each room would alarm the officials of that building about the fire outbreak. The officials, after confirming if the alarm is true or not, could open the door or the respective block/room through a control keypad, and help to resolve the fire before it turns out into a major outbreak. The keypad would prevent opening the door automatically in case of a false alarm, and the fire cure systems inside every room shall help to put it out before it even begins spreading.
